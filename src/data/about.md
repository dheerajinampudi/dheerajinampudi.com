# Intro

- Hello there! My name is Dheeraj, and I adore creating things on Amazon Web Services. My fascination with
AWS began when, as part of my Master's thesis at the University of Manchester in 2014, I conducted a matlab simulation on EC2.
- Fast forward to present, and I am the CTO of Propellor.ai, an analytics product company.
Prior to this, I had the pleasure of working for 3+years as a data scientist at a fitness startup,
building training algorithms and establishing up analytics procedures.
- We use roughly 42 AWS services at Propellor to keep our system up and operating.
- I am a certified AWS Professional solution architect.
- I worked on 16+ different data science projects as a Data Scientist in several domain areas such as QSR, IoT, Social Media, and Retail.
- I also worked at Stratfit as a product manager and associate engineer,
where I learnt about product development and algorithm development for real-world applications such as fitness tracking and prediction.
- In a nutshell, the images below depict my role. It's frightening, but true.
